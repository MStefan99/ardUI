To create your own Activity, create a new
 Activity class as follows: <code>class MyActivity: public Activity {...};</code>. Let's look at this declaration
 more closely. A colon in this declaration means that your custom Activity extends a base Activity class.
 In other words, it will have all the same fields and methods as any other Activity, while allowing
 you to add your own ones. Let's take a look at some of the things an Activity can do for you.</p><p> The most important Activity methods are the Lifecycle methods. ardUI will call these
 functions at appropriate times for you so that you can do certain things in your application. The only
 required method in an Activity is <code>onCreate()</code>. This is the first function called before your
 Activity becomes visible. This is also a good place to create and place all widgets your Activity will need.
 Here is the chart of the entire Activity lifecycle:</p><img src="/img/activity_lifecycle.png" alt="Activity lifecycle diagram" data-anchor="Lifecycle diagram"><p> This diagram may look quite complicated at first but you don't need to implement any functions other than
 <code>onCreate()</code>. However, you might also want to take a look at the <code>onDestroy()</code>. This is the
 function ardUI will call before deleting your Activity. This is the last chance for you to clean up
 any resources you are using in your Activity and free all memory you have allocated for it. Otherwise, it might
 result in a memory leak. Read more about memory management in ardUI
