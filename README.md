_Note: ardUI is in pre-alpha now, many features are still in development_

### What is ardUI?
ardUI is a simple yet powerful framework that allows you to quickly build complex, interactive and beautiful interfaces
for all your projects.

### Why ardUI?
- ardUI is a plug-and-play solution built specifically for Arduino with no extra setup required
- ardUI is platform-independent and works with any displays if the library is provided
- ardUI includes a robust set of widgets out of the box but also allows you to create custom ones
- ardUI runs automatically in the background so you don't need to worry about calling it

### What can you run ardUI on?
ardUI is designed to run on Arduino out of the box, with no extra setup required. However, it can be easily ported over to
_any_ microcontroller running C++.

### What Arduino boards are compatible?
ardUI is designed with efficiency and performance in mind, so theoretically you can run ardUI on _any_ Arduino board.
On lower-end boards, though, you can run out of RAM fairly quickly so at least 8K of RAM is recommended for basic use.

_Arduino Mega or higher is recommended._

### What about non-Arduino boards?
Any other microcontroller supporting C++ can run ardUI but you will not get out-of-the-box compatibility.
In most cases, you will need to port the framework yourself. If you decide to do it, you can find a detailed porting guide in the wiki.

### Learn ardUI
ardUI takes inspiration from modern operating systems and if you've previously made apps for something like Android or
iOS, you'll be familiar with many concepts right away. In case you haven't, [here](https://github.com/MStefan99/ardUI/wiki)
you can find the ardUI wiki with everything you may need: tutorials, guides, reference and more.
