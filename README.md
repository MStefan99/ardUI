_Note: ardUI is in pre-alpha now, many features are still in development_

### What is ardUI?
ardUI is a simple yet powerful framework that allows you to quickly build complex, interactive and beautiful interfaces
for all your projects.

### Why ardUI?
- ardUI is a **plug-and-play** Arduino framework with no setup required
- ardUI is **platform-independent** and works with any displays through a simple API
- ardUI includes a **robust set of widgets** out of the box and allows you to create your own ones
- ardUI **runs in the background** so you can focus on building things that matter

Additionally, ardUI is:
- **Modular**, loading only what's needed
- **Efficient**, saving valuable memory
- **Fast**, making sure you get the performance you expect

### Getting started
Visit the [Getting started guide][get-started] to find examples and start creating with ardUI right away!

### What can you run ardUI on?
ardUI is designed to run on Arduino out of the box, with no extra setup required. However, it can be easily ported over to
_any_ microcontroller that runs C++. If you want to port ardUI to your favorite platform please read the
[Porting guide][porting] on how to get started.

### What Arduino boards are compatible?
ardUI is designed with efficiency and performance in mind, so theoretically you can run ardUI on _any_ Arduino board.
On lower-end boards, though, you can run out of RAM fairly quickly so at least 8K of RAM is recommended
for building larger interfaces.

### Learn ardUI
Many of the ardUI APIs are modeled after Android UI framework to make switching and learning easier so if you are 
familiar with Android development, you already know a lot of ardUI! 
However, there are some differences due to a different programming language and
features unique to ardUI. In the [ardUI documentation][docs] you will find all the information you'll need 
to get started, regardless of your experience.
