_Note: ardUI is in pre-alpha now, many features are still in development_

### What is ardUI?
ardUI is a simple yet powerful framework that allows you to quickly build complex, interactive and beautiful interfaces 
for all your projects. 

### Why ardUI? 
- ardUI is a plug-and-play solution built specifically for Arduino with no extra setup required
- ardUI is platform-independent and works with any displays if the library is provided
- ardUI has a robust set of widgets out of the box but also allows you to create custom ones
- ardUI does not need to be called, since it runs automatically in the background

### What can you run ardUI on?
ardUI is designed to run on Arduino out of the box, with no extra setup required. However, it can be easily ported to
_any_ microcontroller running C++.

### What Arduino boards are compatible?
ardUI is designed with efficiency and performance in mind, so theoretically you can run ardUI on _any_ Arduino board.
On lower-end boards, though, you can run out of RAM fairly quickly so at least 8K of RAM is recommended for basic use.

_Arduino Mega or higher is recommended._
